# handwriting_detection ‚úçÔ∏è

I **love** taking handwritten notes in class. But sometimes (often) my notebooks break, my paper tears, gets dirty, or gets lost. 

*So* I've decided I need to do something about that. 

This is possibly not the most efficient solution but it'll hopefully be fun.

The goal is to create a handwriting detection model that can scan my notes and and transfer them to documents online so I can control F through my notes and store them forever.

Hopefully this works cause I don't want to buy an i-pad ü•≤
